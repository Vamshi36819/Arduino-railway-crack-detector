# Arduino Railway Crack Detector

## Overview

The Arduino Railway Crack Detector is a project designed to monitor and detect structural cracks or defects in railway tracks. Utilizing Arduino and various sensors, this system helps ensure railway safety by alerting maintenance teams to potential issues that could lead to accidents or derailments.

## Features

- **Real-Time Crack Detection**: Monitors railway tracks for signs of structural cracks.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Provides real-time alerts via LEDs, buzzer, or other notification mechanisms.
- **Data Logging**: Logs detection events for further analysis and record-keeping.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Displays system status and alerts in an easy-to-understand format.

## Components

- **Arduino Board**: Arduino Uno, Nano, or any compatible board.
- **Sensors**: Vibration sensors, ultrasonic sensors, or accelerometers.
- **LEDs/Buzzer**: For notifications and alerts.
- **Power Supply**: Battery or external power source for Arduino.
- **Connecting Wires**: For connecting sensors and other components.
- **Optional**: GSM module for remote notifications.
